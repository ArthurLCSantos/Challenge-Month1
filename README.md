🗓️ MONTH 1 – WebGL Fundamentals, Raw Three.js, React + Vite, Zustand & Tailwind  
Goal: Understand how 3D works on the web without abstractions and start integrating with React.  
1 project per week, focusing on fundamentals and progressive integration.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
📅 Week 1 — WebGL & Raw Three.js Fundamentals  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
🎯 Goal: Create a basic 3D scene using raw Three.js (no React)

📚 Topics:

- Scene, camera, renderer, meshes
- Geometries (BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry)
- Lights (AmbientLight, PointLight)
- Materials and textures
- Animations using requestAnimationFrame
- Click and hover events

🛠️ Project: Interactive 3D Cube

- Rotating cube that changes color on click
- Scene with dynamic lighting
- Simple deploy to GitHub Pages or Vercel

🧰 Tools:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- three.js (standalone)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
📅 Week 2 — Modern Setup with React + Vite + Tailwind + Three.js  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
🎯 Goal: Integrate Three.js inside a React component using a modern environment

📚 Topics:

- Setup with Vite + React
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Embedding a Three.js canvas using useRef
- Connecting UI and canvas logic

🛠️ Project: Canvas Component with Tailwind UI

- Page with modern layout and 3D section
- Buttons to change 3D object properties (color, shape, rotation)
- Canvas integrated inside React component

🧰 Tools:

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- three.js (used via useEffect)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
📅 Week 3 — Zustand for Global State Management  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
🎯 Goal: Control canvas parameters using lightweight global state

📚 Topics:

- Creating a Zustand store
- Dynamically changing 3D scene via global state
- Managing object properties (color, shape, rotation)
- React components and canvas communication

🛠️ Project: 3D Control Panel

- UI with buttons and sliders to manage the scene
- Scene with multiple interactive objects
- Toggle scene modes (e.g. light/dark theme)

🧰 Tools:

- React + Vite
- Zustand
- Tailwind CSS
- three.js

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
📅 Week 4 — Mini Portfolio with 3D Background  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
🎯 Goal: Build a personal portfolio page with integrated 3D canvas

📚 Topics:

- Responsive layout with Tailwind
- Organized sections: About, Projects, Contact
- Zustand store for theme mode, animation toggles, etc.
- Optional UI animation using Framer Motion

🛠️ Project: Interactive 3D Portfolio

- Page with “About”, “Projects”, “Contact” sections
- Animated 3D element in the background or side
- Fully responsive and ready for deployment

🧰 Tools:

- React + Vite
- Zustand
- Tailwind CSS
- three.js
- Framer Motion (optional)

🎯 Month-End Result:
By the end of the month, you’ll have 4 published projects, a solid understanding of raw WebGL with Three.js, a modern React + Vite setup, and practical use of Zustand and Tailwind for building visually controlled 3D interfaces.
